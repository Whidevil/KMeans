# KMeans

## **Project Tiltle** :
## Analysis and prediction of **"Mall_Customers.csv"** of american mall market called as pheonix mall to find out how many customers have visited to a particular shop on basis of production of   versus spending score.

## **Disclamier** : 
## In this particular dataset we assume annual income as centeroid and spending score from the range 1 to 100 called as DataNodes of the cluster

## **Problem Statement**:
##  o The American finance market as per the gdp of 2011 **'Pheonix_trillums mall'** as in the first range out of 5. The owner of the mall wants exact which shop or product such in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
## As a data science engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcoming gdp rate based on No of clusters.
## The client wants atleast top 5 clusters(shops).

## **Conclusion :**
## According to the model basic prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster1 which is red in color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 DataNodes.

## **References :**
## The model building algorithm develops for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represents centeroids which is max to max only 3.
